**set up instructions**

The dataset has not been uploaded to avoid exceeding github lfs resource limits. download and extract the dataset inside the Data folder.

download all dependencies and make sure u're using a compatible python version.
I'm using python kernel 3.11 here as the versions above it are not supported by pycaret.

note: it's better to install pycaret first before other modules if we are using the same virtual env. cuz installing it later will replace them with the versions used by pycaret. why? PyCaret has a number of dependencies (like scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, etc.), and sometimes these dependencies have specific version requirements. When you install PyCaret after other libraries, it might cause some of your previously installed packages to be downgraded or upgraded to versions that are compatible with PyCaret.
